How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It changed my life.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    To see where you went wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros of manual saving: the saves have purpose and meaning.
    Cons of manual saving: I might forget.
    Pros of auto-saving: I don't have to remember to save.
    Cons of auto-saving: a lot of useless saves

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    for reasons

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By getting 2 id's from the git log and comparing them with git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    This question is kind of confusing...

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Life
